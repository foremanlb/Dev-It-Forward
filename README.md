## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

Create and Read will be the first and easiest part of CRUD
CSS Styling will be fun and challenging (hoping to integrate/research new styling techniques to make the page easy on the eyes)

### Weaknesses:

Still having problems targeting specific information and Link/Routing so that when a user clicks on a image it will send them to a specific page based upon the ID of the tattoo object.
BUTTONS
Not sure how to I'm going to display the images by (my plan was to display the images by descending create time so that most recently posted tattoo object displays first)

### Opportunities:

To strengthen my weaknesses within React both conceptually and technically, work on being able to track my workflow.
Looking to add a new fully fleshed out passion project that is marginally more complex than my first project.

### Threats:

Sometimes I get stuck and throw my plan of attack out the window and start panic coding while not understanding what exactly my code or plan is doing
Trying to shift my workflow and mentality high-low to a fluid slow burn build up.
